# Project: Linked Lists.

In this project, I demonstrate my problem solving though a build up for linked lists. While there is no UI for this project, it is a demonstration for the foundation on Data Structures and algorithms. 

This project allows you to achieve the following functionalities through my Linked List class builder:

- append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
- prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
- size returns the total number of nodes in the list
- head returns the first node in the list
- tail returns the last node in the list
- at(index) returns the node at the given index
- pop removes the last element from the list
- contains(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
- find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
- toString represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null

- insertAt(value, index) that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
- removeAt(index) that removes the node at the given index.

To run or test out the project:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/john-walter-munene/Project-Linked-Lists`.
2. Install necessary npm packages by running `npm run install`
3. Test out the project by using different values and running `node src\main.js`
4. Alternatively run `npm run build` and inspect the index.html file on your browser console.
